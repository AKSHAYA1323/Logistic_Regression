 Logistic Regression Classification

## 📌 Objective
Build a **binary classifier** using **Logistic Regression** to classify breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset: **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)**
Loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries  
2. Loaded and explored dataset  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Standardized features  
5. Trained **Logistic Regression** model  
6. Evaluated using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall
   - ROC-AUC Curve
7. Tuned decision threshold  
8. Visualized Sigmoid Function
